**Unit 4: Using The Work Of Others** <span id="4"></span> 
*A well-placed quote can make all the difference when you are making an
argument. A quote can convince your reader that other respected,
intelligent individuals have shared your perspective; it can argue your
point with winning style or rhetorical power; it can prop up your
argument where you may need help; and so forth. This unit will teach you
how to use the work of others in order to strengthen your argument while
ensuring that you avoid letting others take the spotlight. This unit
will also address the problem of plagiarism—and how and why to avoid it
at all costs. *

    Instructions: In an essay of 1000 to 1300 words, discuss the effects
    of “social media” on written communication in the first decade of
    the twenty-first century. Consider your own experiences with media
    such as Facebook, MySpace, YouTube, blogs, Twitter, and e-mail as
    you formulate your argument. Use the pre-writing techniques you
    learned in Unit 1 to focus your topic and refine your thesis. Use
    research where necessary to bolster your argument and respond to any
    counterarguments. Be sure to cite and document your research in
    accordance with MLA style standards.  
      
     When you have completed your first draft, use the questions in the

    to reflect the results of your analysis.

    draft, read it aloud to someone else. Then revise and edit one more
    time to address your friend’s suggestions and questions, as well as
    any issues that you notice during your reading.
