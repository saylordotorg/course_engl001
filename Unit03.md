**Unit 3: Focus, Cohesion, and Style** <span id="3"></span> 
*Style refers to the way in which you write a sentence and assemble it
within a sequence of sentences. A sound writing style is not a luxury;
it is a necessity if you intend to communicate your ideas clearly and
effectively. You may write with perfect grammar, but if your style needs
work, your audience may not understand what you are trying to say. While
“style” is inherently subjective, this unit will provide you with some
guidelines that are generally agreed upon by most academics. The goal of
this unit will be to teach you to write as clearly, persuasively, and
elegantly as possible.*
