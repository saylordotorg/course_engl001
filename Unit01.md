**Unit 1: Redefining What It Means To Write** <span id="1"></span> 
*We begin this course by refining how we think about writing. Let’s
begin by acknowledging that writing is a difficult, complex process. It
does not come easily; it takes quite a bit of work and thought. However,
if you realize that all writing is a conversation between yourself and
an audience, then the task becomes a little bit easier. If you envision
your work as a response to an existing prompt, the way you write will be
shaped by the reader with whom you are “speaking.” Imagine, for example,
that someone asks you, “Why does it rain?” If that someone were your
five-year-old cousin, you might respond one way, but if it were your
sixty-five-year-old aunt, you would likely respond differently. You will
need to approach every writing project with that same awareness of
audience.  
    
 We will also work to recognize writing as a process rather than a
product. You often need to start writing in order to know what you think
about a subject. Keep this in mind as you work through this unit.*
