Course Syllabus for "ENGL001: English Composition I"
----------------------------------------------------

No matter what career you pursue, you must be able to communicate
effectively and clearly if you want to be successful.  This course will
enhance your ability to do so by sharpening your critical thinking and
writing skills.  We will begin with a unit designed to change the way in
which you think about writing.  First, you will learn to think of
writing not as a solitary act but as a conversation between yourself and
an audience.  In this light, writing becomes a dynamic, interactive, and
creative rather than a rote practice.  You will also begin to value
writing as a process – an admittedly difficult one – rather than a
product.  You will come to see that writing is an act of discovery
rather than a recitation of prefabricated ideas. Because this course is
designed specifically for students in a university setting, the second
unit will focus on academic writing.  We will learn how to respond to an
assignment or test question by using the “PWR-Writing” or
“Power-Writing” Method (PWR: Pre-write, Write, Revise) while learning
the ins and outs of building a solid thesis and supporting that thesis
with evidence.  The remaining units will focus on the minutiae of good
writing practices from style to citation methodology. Because the goal
of this course is to improve your ability to write clear,
grammatically-sound expository and persuasive prose, every unit will
include a “Grammar Capsule,” focusing on a specific grammatical issue.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   demonstrate mastery of the principles of grammar, usage, mechanics,
    and sentence structure;
-   identify the thesis statement in an essay;
-   develop a thesis statement, structure it in an introductory
    paragraph, and support it with the body of the essay;
-   organize ideas logically within an essay and employ adequate
    transitional devices to ensure coherence, flow, and focus;
-   differentiate between rhetorical strategies and write with an
    awareness of rhetorical technique and audience;
-   differentiate between tones and write with an awareness of how tone
    affects the audience’s experience;
-   demonstrate critical and analytical thinking for reading and writing
    purposes;
-   quote, paraphrase, and document the work of others; and
-   write sentences that vary in length and structure.
