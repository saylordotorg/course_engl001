**Unit 2: Academic Writing** <span id="2"></span> 
*As a student at the university level, you will need to know how to
write an effective academic essay. At its core, any academic essay is an
argument. By argument, we do not mean a series of aggressive verbal
attacks; instead, we mean language used to persuade someone to adopt a
perspective. For example, you might be assigned an essay on how the
Revolutionary War changed American culture. You may not have known it,
but your response to this question is an argument. It is designed to
persuade your audience that the War changed American culture for the
three or four precise reasons you have identified. As you prepare to
draft your essay, you will need to identify evidence, intuit possible
inconsistencies or contradictions that your argument involves, and
anticipate counterarguments (those that will argue that American culture
did not change or that there are actually twenty different reasons why
it changed, not just the three or four you identified).  
    
 This unit will go over these issues in great detail and will provide
you with a highly structured approach to writing an argument. By the end
of this unit, you should be ready to write an academic essay.*

     Instructions: Read this article to learn more about *pathos*.
    *Pathos* is the Greek word for “emotion,” and the rhetorical method
    of *pathos *refers to appealing to the emotions of one’s audience in
    order to persuade. Make sure to also view the video embedded on the
    webpage. Without offering evidence, pathos can be little more than
    an invalid, emotional response in your writing; however, using all
    rhetorical appeals (ethos, logos, and pathos) is the best way to
    strengthen an argument. Make sure to provide appropriate evidence
    when using pathos in your arguments.  
        
     Reading this article should take you approximately 20 minutes.
